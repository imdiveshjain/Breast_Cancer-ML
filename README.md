# Breast_Cancer-ML

This project aims to predict the likelihood of breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. The predictive model is built and trained using a dataset containing features derived from breast cancer biopsies. Various machine learning techniques are explored to create an accurate and reliable prediction model.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies. Features include characteristics such as texture, perimeter, smoothness, and more. The dataset is preprocessed within the Jupyter Notebook to handle missing values, normalize data, and extract relevant features for the machine learning model.

Dependencies
